	<b>Content Marketing</b> is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.

	<p>Here is a quote from forbes website:</p>

	<!--Quotes written using blockquote-->


	<blockquote cite="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshsteimle/2014/09/19/what-is-content-marketing/?sh=24743a9110b9"> <q>Content marketing is a marketing technique of creating and distributing valuable, relevant and consistent content to attract and acquire a clearly defined audience – with the objective of driving profitable customer action.</q></blockquote>

	<p>Go back and read the content marketing definition one more time, but this time remove the relevant and valuable. That’s the difference between content marketing and the other informational garbage you get from companies trying to sell you “stuff.” Companies send us information all the time – it’s just that most of the time it’s not very relevant or valuable. That’s what makes content marketing so intriguing in today’s environment of thousands of marketing messages per person per day.
	
	<p>Regardless of what type of marketing tactics you use, content marketing should be part of your process, not something separate. <mark> Quality content is part of all forms of marketing </mark>:
	
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Social Media Marketing:</b> Content marketing strategy comes before your social media strategy.</li>
		<li><b>SEO:</b> Search engines reward businesses that publish quality, consistent content.</li>
		<li><b>PR:</b> Successful PR strategies address issues readers care about, not their business.</li>
		<li><b>PPC:</b> For PPC to work, you need great content behind it.</li>
		<li><b>Inbound Marketing:</b> Content is key to driving inbound traffic and leads.</li>
		<li><b>Content Strategy:</b> Content strategy is part of most content marketing strategies.</li>
